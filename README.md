# beautiful-cell-data-pipelines

Various scripts and data pipelines to pull and clean data used in Asimov Press' interactive data briefs about the cell. The overall goal is to get to contextualize biology in numbers.

We're starting small, literally, with the Cell, and experimenting with different dataset to understand the challenges as we clean and pull interesting data. Over time, this will turn into a unified set of pipelines.

Sorry if it's still a little janky now ;).

## Data pipelines

### Biological sizes from Bionumbers

We used the [Bionumbers](https://book.bionumbers.org/) dataset to visualize biological sizes. Check out the [pipeline](./bionumbers) to learn more about how we clean the data.
