# What is a Cell Made From?

_We have collected a variety of datasets that break down two aspects of _E. coli_ bacteria: Their macromolecular composition and the abundance of various proteins in different growth media._

## Project Overview

The datasets in this folder were collected for an Asimov Press article entitled: "What Are Cells Made From?"

## Datasets

This section describes the datasets used in this project.

### Dataset 1: *Macromolecular Compositions*

- **Description:**  
  This data breaks down the macromolecular composition of _E. coli_'s dry mass.
- **Source:**

- **Format:**  
  Excel file

### Dataset 2: *Protein Abundance in Various Conditions*

- **Description:**  
  This tidy dataset breaks down absolute numbers of proteins for _E. coli_ cells grown in various media conditions, such as glucose, acetate, and at varying temperatures or pH.
- **Source:**

- **Format:**  
  CSV

### Dataset 3: *Protein Abundance | PaxDB*

- **Description:**  
  A simple download of the PaxDB database, which notably does not seem to include cytosolic proteins, or protein abundances in varied conditions.
